# MusicShape
A unity script to turn audio into blendshape input.

HOW TO USE

0. Import the unitypackage, inside is an example scene. Use it for reference.


1. Creat an audiosource, preferrably on your camera (uses audio listener so disable spatialize for full input)

2. Add "FrequencyListener" script to that component (same as audio source!)

3. Add your mesh (with the blendshapes on it) to the scene and either put the "GooShapeV2" script on it or put it somewhere and select your mesh as target.

4. Fill in values (see PDF)

To test enter play mode
